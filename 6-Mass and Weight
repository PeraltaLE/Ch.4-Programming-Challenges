// Mass and Weight
//
// Scientists measure an object's mass in kilograms and it's weight in newtons.
// 
// If you know the amount of mass that an object has, you can calculate its weight, in newtons, with
// the following formula:
//
// Weight = mass x 9.8
//
// Write a program that asks the user to enter an object's mass, then calculates and displays its weight.
// 
// If the object weighs more than 1,000 newtons, display a message indicating that it is too heavy.
// If the object weighs less than 10 newtons, display a message indicating that the object is too light.
